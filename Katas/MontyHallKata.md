## Objective
Prove that switching doors leads to more favorable outcomes in the Monty Hall problem by creating a simulation program and running 1000 simulations for each strategy.

## Background
The Monty Hall Problem [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) was first described in 1975. It goes like this:

    Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

The answer is (surprisingly to most people) -- **yes**. 

## Output Format
At a minimum, your program should output each strategy and the number of times your simulator won the prize expressed as a percent of the total number of simulations.
