# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a simple counting game that teaches multiples of three and five. It does so by making the player(s) count from 1 to 100, and every number is counted normally unless it is a multiple of three, five, or both. If the number is a multiple of 3, the player replaces the number with the word *Fizz!*. For multiples of 5, the number is replaced by the word *Buzz!*. The player should say *FizzBuzz!* if the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5.

### Requirements: 
- Multiples of 3 are represented by the word "*Fizz*"
- Multiples of 5 are represented by the word "*Buzz*"
- Multiples of **both** 3 AND 5 are represented by the word "*FizzBuzz*"

### Your Task:
Create a program that prints out numbers 1 - 100, but multiples of 3 and 5 follow the premise of the game.

### Example of what your output should look like:
> 1
> 
> 2
>
> Fizz
> 
> 4
> 
> Buzz
> 
> Fizz
> 
> Sizzle
> 
> 8
> 
> Fizz
> 
> Buzz
>
> 11
>
> Fizz
>
> 13
>
> 14
>
> FizzBuzz
> 
> ...continued to 100.


### Creating a challenge:
Once you have solved the first part of this, add variations to the game! 

Begin with these new requirement:
- Multiples of 7 are represented by the word "*Sizzle*"
- Multiples of both 7 and 3 are represented by the word "*SizzleFizz*"
- - Multiples of both 7 and 5 are represented by the word "*SizzleBuzz*"

### Example of what your new output should look like:
> 1
> 
> 2
>
> Fizz
> 
> 4
> 
> Buzz
> 
> Fizz
> 
> Sizzle
> 
> 8
> 
> Fizz
> 
> Buzz
>
> 11
>
> Fizz
>
> 13
>
> 14
>
> FizzBuzz
> ...continued to 100.


#### If you were able to solve for the requirements above within a couple of hours, then increase the challenge by creating your own variations!
