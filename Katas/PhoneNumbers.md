# Phone Numbers

The objective of this exercise is to determine of the given list of phone numbers is consistent.

In order to be consistent, **no number is a prefix of another** in the phone list.

Author Emily Bache has [provided sample data](http://github.com/emilybache/Phone-Numbers-Kata) to help test your solution. 

**Example:**

> Jake: 97 11 25 15
> 
> Jane: 21 193 589
> 
> Referral and information helpline: 211

The list above is **not** consistent because the first three digits of Jane's number is the helpline number. The call would be directed to the helpline and it would not be possible to call Jane. 

### Additional Requirement
- Add functionality so a person's phone number can be found by their name.
